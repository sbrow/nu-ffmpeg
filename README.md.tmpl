# nu-ffmpeg

Utility commands for working with ffmpeg in nushell.

## Capabilities

- Return tables from `ffprobe`

```nu
{{ ffprobe_example }}
```

- `ffprobe` multiple files at once

```nu
{{ ffprobe_multiple_files_example }}
```

- Use `streams`, `streams video`, and `streams audio` to filter `ffprobe` output

```nu
{{ ffprobe_streams_video_example }}
{{ ffprobe_streams_audio_example }}
```

- get the `dimensions` of a video stream as a record

```nu
{{ ffprobe_dimensions_example }}
```
- Tab-completion for filter options. i.e. `fps --round<tab>` will yield `zero inf down up near`
- Apply and parse complex filters to a video (Work In Progress)
